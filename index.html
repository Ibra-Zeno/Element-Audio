              <h4>Shuma Begum</h4>
              <p>
                I am a London based audio artist, with a Bangladeshi background.
                I am passionate about bringing art to life through various sound
                disciplines. I strive to represent women and ethnic minorities
                in the audio industry. I took a leap of faith when I decided to
                study Music and Sound Design at university. A career in an
                artistic role was incomprehensible in upbringing, but I decided
                to create my own path in the professional world. I consider
                myself an amorphous person, not limited in the roles I want to
                pursue in life, thus leading to the birth of Element Audio. I
                wanted to offer a variety of services to clients, with the aim
                of helping people deliver content that fulfils their artistic
                vision.

          <h2>My <span>Portfolio</span></h2>
        </div>
        <p class="wind-text">
          Hello, and welcome to my online portfolio! As an audio professional, I
          take pride in showcasing my various projects and experiences in sound
          design, music production, and live performance. <br />
          <br />

          First up, you'll find a selection of foley projects that I've worked
          on. From creating realistic footsteps to crafting unique sound effects
          for film and TV, foley work is all about creating a world of sound
          that complements the visuals on screen. I've had the pleasure of
          working on several foley projects, and I'm excited to share some of my
          favorites with you. <br />
          <br />

          Next, you'll find a collection of songs that I've produced and
          composed. These tracks showcase my ability to work in a variety of
          genres, from electronic to acoustic, and my skills as a songwriter and
          arranger. I'm always experimenting with new sounds and techniques, and
          I believe these tracks demonstrate my passion for music and my
          commitment to creating something unique and engaging. <br />
          <br />

          If you're interested in audiovisual projects, you'll find several
          clips that I've worked on, ranging from short films to experimental
          installations. These projects allow me to explore the intersection of
          sound and image, and to create immersive experiences that engage both
          the eyes and ears. <br />
          <br />

          Of course, no portfolio would be complete without a mixing project.
          Mixing is a crucial part of the production process, and I pride myself
          on my ability to take a raw recording and transform it into a
          polished, professional track. Whether it's a song or a piece of
          dialogue, I'm always striving to bring out the best in every element
          of a mix. <br />
          <br />

          Finally, I invite you to check out my live performance with singing
          bowls. This unique instrument has a rich history and a beautiful
          sound, and I've had the pleasure of incorporating it into my live
          shows. My performance combines singing bowls with other instruments
          and effects, creating a meditative and immersive experience for the
          audience. <br />
          <br />

          Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. I'm excited to
          share my work with you, and I hope it inspires you to explore the
          world of sound and music! <br />
